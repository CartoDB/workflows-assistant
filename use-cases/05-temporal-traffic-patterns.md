I have bike traffic sensor data for Madrid in `cartodb-on-gcp-datascience.dvicente`. The data has dates and bike counts. Aggregate the traffic by day of week and by month to find temporal patterns. Create a summary showing when bike usage peaks throughout the week and year.

Use `$WORKFLOWS_TEMP_LOCATION` as the Workflows temp location and the connection stored in `$WORKFLOWS_CONNECTION`.
