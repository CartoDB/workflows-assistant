I have various bike-related datasets for Madrid in `cartodb-on-gcp-datascience.dvicente` - infrastructure, parking, stations, and accidents. Create an H3 grid and enrich each cell with: bike lane density, parking count, station proximity, and accident rate. Combine these into a weighted composite bike-friendliness index.

Use `$WORKFLOWS_TEMP_LOCATION` as the Workflows temp location and the connection stored in `$WORKFLOWS_CONNECTION`.
