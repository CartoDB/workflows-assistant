I have both bike lane infrastructure and accident data for Madrid in `cartodb-on-gcp-datascience.dvicente`. I want to understand if bike infrastructure reduces accidents. Create buffers around the bike lanes and do a spatial join to compare accident density inside vs. outside the infrastructure buffers.

Use `$WORKFLOWS_TEMP_LOCATION` as the Workflows temp location and the connection stored in `$WORKFLOWS_CONNECTION`.
