# Session Wrap-up Protocol

Use this skill to create a session summary document when:
- The user confirms a workflow is complete/correct
- You cannot proceed further (blocked by bugs, missing capabilities, etc.)
- The user explicitly asks to wrap up

## Output Location

Create the document at: `./session-reports/<date>-<brief-topic>.md`

Example: `./session-reports/2025-01-13-spatial-join-workflow.md`

## Document Template

```markdown
# Session Report: <Brief Description>

**Date**: <YYYY-MM-DD>
**Workflow**: <workflow filename or "N/A">
**Outcome**: <Completed | Partially Completed | Blocked>

## 1. Errors Encountered

List any errors that occurred during the session, including:
- Validation errors and their root causes
- Execution failures
- CLI errors or unexpected behavior

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| <error message> | <why it happened> | <how it was fixed, or "unresolved"> |

If no errors: "No errors encountered."

## 2. Tool/Capability Limitations

Document workarounds you had to use because tools were lacking:

| Limitation | Workaround Used | Ideal Solution |
|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| <what was missing> | <how you worked around it> | <what would have been better> |

Examples:
- Had to use raw SQL because no component existed for X
- Could not validate Y because CLI doesn't support Z
- Manual schema lookup because introspection unavailable

If no limitations: "No significant limitations encountered."

## 3. Improvement Opportunities

Suggestions for future sessions or tooling improvements:

- **Documentation**: Missing docs, unclear instructions, outdated examples
- **Components**: New components that would be useful
- **CLI**: Missing flags, better error messages, new commands
- **Agent behavior**: Prompts or procedures that could be refined

## 4. New Learnings

Things discovered during this session that were NOT in the existing documentation:

| Learning | Source | Should Document? |
|----------|--------|------------------|
| <what you learned> | <how you discovered it> | <Yes/No - where> |

Examples:
- Column naming conventions not mentioned in docs
- Undocumented parameter behavior
- Provider-specific quirks
- Error patterns not in troubleshooting guide

If no new learnings: "No undocumented learnings."

## Instructions

1. **Create the directory** if it doesn't exist: `mkdir -p ./session-reports`
2. **Reflect on the session** - review what happened, what worked, what didn't
3. **Be specific** - include actual error messages, component names, CLI commands
4. **Be honest** - document your own suboptimal decisions, not just tool issues
5. **Prioritize actionable items** - focus on things that can be improved

## After Creating the Report

- Tell the user the report location
- Briefly summarize key findings (1-2 sentences)
- Ask if they want to review or add anything
