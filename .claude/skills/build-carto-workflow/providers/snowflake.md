# Snowflake Provider Notes

Provider-specific details for building workflows with Snowflake connections.

---

## Table Fully-Qualified Names

Format: `DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE`

```
DVICENTE_AT.WORKFLOWS_DATA.MADRID_BIKE_ACCIDENTS
```

Use `carto connections browse <connection>` to navigate `database > schema > table`.

---

## Column Casing

Snowflake **uppercases all unquoted identifiers** automatically. When referencing columns in workflow inputs, always use UPPERCASE names:

```json
{ "name": "geo", "type": "Column", "value": "GEOM" }
{ "name": "column", "type": "Column", "value": "ACCIDENT_TYPE" }
```

Use `carto connections describe <connection> "DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE"` to see exact column names. They will be uppercase.

**Note**: Snowflake is case-insensitive for unquoted identifiers — `geom`, `Geom`, and `GEOM` all resolve to the same column. However, using UPPERCASE consistently avoids ambiguity and matches what `describe` returns.

**This applies to component-generated columns too.** For example, the `native.buffer` component creates a column called `geom_buffer`, but on Snowflake it becomes `GEOM_BUFFER`. When referencing generated columns in downstream nodes (e.g. spatial join's `maintablejoincolumn`), use UPPERCASE.

---

## Analytics Toolbox

Snowflake uses the Analytics Toolbox at `CARTO.CARTO`. This should be resolved automatically when using `--connection`.

The AT path resolves automatically when using `--connection`.

---

## Schedule Expressions

Snowflake uses standard cron expressions:

```
"0 8 * * *"       # Daily at 08:00
"0 9 * * 1"       # Mondays at 09:00
"0 */2 * * *"     # Every 2 hours
```

---

## SQL Dialect

- Uses `CREATE TRANSIENT TABLE` (not `CREATE TABLE`) for intermediate results
- Uses `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` for source nodes
- Identifier quoting uses double quotes: `"DATABASE"."SCHEMA"."TABLE"`
- Lateral flatten syntax: `lateral FLATTEN(input => array_col) elem`

---

## connectionProvider Value

Set `"connectionProvider": "snowflake"` in the workflow JSON top-level. This value must match the actual provider of the connection you validate/execute against. Mismatches will cause SQL generation to use the wrong dialect.

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": "1.0.0",
  "title": "My Snowflake Workflow",
  "connectionProvider": "snowflake",
  "nodes": [],
  "edges": []
}
```
